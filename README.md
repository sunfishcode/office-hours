# Open Office Hours

I'm going to start holding open office hours, using http://meet.jit.si. Say hi, chat about WASI, Wasm, Rust, capability-based security, and more!

The current times are Tuesdays at 12:00am UTC (which is on Mondays in American time zones), and Tuesdays at 03:00pm UTC, repeating weekly. [Calendar link](https://user.fm/calendar/v1-a36d75241c715d7735cec38a8eb29632/Office%20Hours.ics)

I'll post a `meet.jit.si` meeting URL on https://hachyderm.io/@sunfish/ shortly before each hour. There are no appointments or reservations, so feel free to hop in any time during the hour. Video is not necessary.

This is not an official Bytecode Alliance function, however I intend to follow and enforce the Bytecode Alliance Code of Conduct.
