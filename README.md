# Open Office Hours

I'm going to start holding open office hours, using http://meet.jit.si. Say hi, chat about WASI, Wasm, Rust, capability-based security, and more!

The current times are Mondays at 11:00pm UTC, and Tuesdays at 02:00pm UTC, repeating weekly. [Calendar link](https://user.fm/calendar/v1-a36d75241c715d7735cec38a8eb29632/Office%20Hours.ics)

Send me a message for a meeting URL!
